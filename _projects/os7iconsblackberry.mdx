I was quite involved in the BlackBerry scene during my highschool days. At some point
I noticed the Curve 8520 didn't get the OS7 operating system update. My schoolfriends,
and people visiting my BlackBerry-focused website Berryness were furious.

So I built a theme to mimic the UI refresh the OS7 update provided, and put it on the
BlackBerry AppWorld for free. I don't remember the details but it got thousands of
downloads very quickly.

So I set the price to $0.79 (the cheapest pricepoint available to me).

80,000 people bought my theme all over the world. Before BlackBerry retired the AppWorld,
it was rated 4.5 stars with hundreds of reviews. In December 2012 the theme
was featured by the AppWorld.
