I was a blogger before Instagram made it popular. Whilst Berryness (see above)
was on the decline, I quickly realised I had boxed myself in to the BlackBerry niche.

I leveraged the audience I had already built and launched Technouz.

The site is powered by a tailored WordPress engine with custom plugins and themes
to my liking. The original theme was built using Boostrap, and later rewritted to
Tailwind in 2022.

Since launch, Technouz has been visited by millions of users worldwide. The record
currently stands at 22,000 unique visitors in one day.
