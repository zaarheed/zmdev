A BlackBerry-focused website active 2011-2014. At it's peak Berryness received a little
over 1,000,000 unique visitors per month and generated Â£2,000 per month through Google AdSense.

Berryness also generated income from bespoke ad deals, sponsorship packages and premium memberships
for access to paywalled content.

Then one day, BlackBerry's marketshare began to dwindle as users moved to iPhones and Androids.
Berryness consequently took a nosedive as less and less people had a BlackBerry smartphone they wanted
to customise. With the project's days numbered, I started looking for a buyer and eventually sold the
website to a guy called Chris. I've never heard from him since.
